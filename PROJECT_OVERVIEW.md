# Intervyo – Project Overview

Intervyo is an AI-powered interview simulation and evaluation platform designed to replicate real-world technical and HR interviews.

This is not a generic chatbot-based interview tool.
Intervyo focuses on realism, structured evaluation, and measurable improvement.

## Problem Statement
Most interview preparation platforms:
- Ask generic questions
- Provide vague or motivational feedback
- Fail to simulate real interview pressure
- Do not track improvement objectively

Human mock interviews are costly, inconsistent, and biased.

## Solution
Intervyo solves this by:
- Conducting structured, timed interviews
- Evaluating responses using predefined criteria
- Tracking performance trends over time
- Predicting weaknesses before real interviews

## Target Users
- Students preparing for placements
- Developers preparing for technical interviews
- Professionals switching roles or companies

## Core Capabilities
- AI interview simulation (technical, HR, mixed)
- Criteria-based evaluation and scoring
- Interview history and progress tracking
- Weakness prediction and improvement planning
- Company recommendations and success probability

## What Makes Intervyo Different
- Structured interviews instead of free chat
- Actionable feedback instead of praise
- Predictive analysis instead of reactive feedback
- Skill improvement over vanity metrics

## Vision
To become a standard, unbiased interview preparation system focused on exposing weaknesses and driving real improvement.
